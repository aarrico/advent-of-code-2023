# Purpose

Using the 2023 Advent of Code challenge as an opprotunity to learn Rust. As such, the solutions may not be the best versions that they can be, but the goal is to improve my understanding of how Rust works and become a Rustacean!

# Motivation

My interest in Rust comes from my scientific computing background. My first exposure to programming was a C++ course my first semester of college as a physics major. I strongly prefer typed, compiled languages to write production-ready applications. Scripting langauges have a ime and place, imo. Python is my favorite langauge, but I prefer using it for helper scripts and prototyping over running a high-performance server.

Rust caught my attention as it seems as though the creators took a hard look at issues plauguing various langauges today and did their best to offer an alternative way of thinking in approaching these issues, like the concept of ownership and not having `null` as an allowable value.

The overall goal for doing this challenge is to challenge the way I think as an engineer and become a better engineer by learning how to write more resiliant and reliable code in ANY language.
